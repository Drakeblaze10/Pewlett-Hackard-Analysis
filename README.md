# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Requested by Pewlett Hackard, I was tasked with determining the number of retiring employess per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program using SQL.

## Results
- Using INNER JOIN I was capable of merging two tables for a readable table filtered by birth date.

- Using Distinct I was able to remove duplicate employee numbers cleaning the data for readibility.

- Using COUNT I was able to retrieve the number of employees pulled from the Unique titles table.

- Finally bringing in multiple tables with filters to retrieve active employees who are eligibles to be part of a mentorship

## Summary

### Follow up
- 72,458 employees will be retiring in the "silver tsunami." Of which the majority of them will be Senior Engineers, with approx. 86% of the Senior Engineers retiring in the "silver tsunami." The least of which being the Assistant Engineers with approx. 7% retiring in the "silver tsunami." 

-Using the total number of employees per department (as shown below Table 1) and comparing it to the list of current employees retiring soon (Table 2). The departments will have to have to soon-to-be-retirees mentor several employees as either a group lead or an equivalent position as the silver tsunami takes only a small portion from the departments in relation to the total
