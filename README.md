# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Requested by Pewlett Hackard, I was tasked with determining the number of retiring employess per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program using SQL.

## Results

!CHART(Inner Join) []
- Using Distinct to remove duplicate titles
- Retiring titles COUNT
- Mentorship_eligibility
